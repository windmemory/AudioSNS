##Summary

This project is developed in 2013 April, so it is written in Objective - C, not Swift. 

This is just a Demo, there is no web server behind this app, all the statuses are recorded in the backend. 

This project uses OpenEars framework to implement the voice recognition. Link: http://www.politepix.com/openears/

##How to use

After you clone this repo, you have to use CocoaPods to install the dependencies, after you finish installing all the dependencies, you could build and run this app. 

Before testing this, you should first record some "statuses" into the app, to record "statuses", please click on the "**" button on the top left corner, then you will go into a backend interface, you can just type the name of your fake friend and then press and hold the record button, after you finish recording just release the button, then the status will be automatically recorded. 

In the backend interface, there is a switch on the bottom right corner, which is a switch between verbose mode and simple mode, that means if you switch on, the app will give you a shorten instruction each step, but if you switch off, the app will give you complete instruction (this is too long for me to tolerate).

After you set up all those fake statuses, you could start testing this app by click on the "start" button. You can always stop this app by either clicking the stop button or say "quit" when the app ask for instruction.
